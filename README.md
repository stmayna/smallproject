# Notes
## 3. Loop and branching.
### 3.1 The For Loop.
```
for loop_variable in some_numbers:
     <code line 1>
     <code line 2>
```

```
for loop_variable in range(start, stop, step):
```

### 3.2 The While Loop.
```
while some_condition: #Loop header 
     <code line 1> # 1st line in loop body.
     <code line 2> # 2nd line in loop body.
```

### 3.3 Branching.
```
if condition_1:         # testing condition 1
    <code line 1>
    <code line 2>
    ...

elif condition_2:       # testing condition 2
    <code line 1>
    <code line 2>
    ...

elif condition_3:       # testing condition 3
    <code line 1>
    <code line 2>
    ...

else:
    <code line 1>
    <code line 2>
    ...
```
